# LSTM for SWL Prediction
This is an implementation of an LSTM model to predict ground water level. Due to confidentiality, unfortunately the data used to train, validate, and test the model cannot be uploaded to the repository. The PyTorch library is required to run the code, and Tensorboard is also required to run, and highly recommended to be installed in order to visualize the training and validation, as well as effects of different hyperparameters used to train the model.
